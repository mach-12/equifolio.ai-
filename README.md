## Background
üìä Public investment in stocks and mutual funds has been steadily rising in India. This project addresses the need for a product that assists users in creating diversified portfol
ios, especially those new to the stock market. We've developed a tool that uses historical stock data from the NSE NIFTY indices to enable users to construct portfolios with potentially good long-term returns.


## ML Algorithm

- **Input** is investment amount and the Stock Index of choice. 10 year historical stock data is retrieved using  `yfinance`.

- Calculating returns and variances, it utilizes **K-means clustering** to group stocks, determining an optimal number of clusters and filtering a portfolio based on these clusters.

- We then compute portfolio metrics like **variance**, **volatility**, and expected annual return for the filtered portfolio. Further optimization is performed using the `Efficient Frontier` module to maximize the **Sharpe ratio** and find optimal weights for the selected stocks.
  
- Finally, using these optimized weights and current stock prices, we perform a **discrete allocation**, determining the allocation of funds across these stocks for a specified total portfolio value.
  
- The **Output** includes the allocation details, portfolio statistics, and visual plots illustrating the clustering and portfolio's adjusted close prices.
